# blueprint-web

*February 27, 2016*

This repository contains the sample solutions to the code we wrote today!

## HTML/CSS

We created HTML elements in about.html and styled it with CSS in style.css.

## Javascript/JQuery

We learned how to handle events and animate things on the screen. We also got a taste of what an API was!

## Storing data on Firebase

We learned how to store data in a persistent database (Firebase), which allowed us to make a blog.

**Note**: Some of you figured out to do XSS (thanks for the redirect to donaldjtrump.com...), so I've turned off write-access to the communal Firebase (https://blueprint-blog.firebaseio.com). :( If you want to be able to "Publish" entries, make sure to use your own Firebase database!
